- Yosemite National Park
- limited observational data, no experiments, and very little time 
- sampled 2,000 meadows and found 200 that had toads in it

Method:
- try to predict which are good breeding meadows and which are bad for the toads
- use meadow attributes (elevation, size, vegetation types, meadow distance, and slope to nearest meadow); 
  remote sensing 
  
- able to extract how many days in a year was a meadow covered in snow from 2001-2007
  - is it on average a snowy meadow, does snow melt quickly, etc.

- took advantage of landsat data

- created first ever database of 10,000 meadows in the Sierra Nevada*
  - can be used for lots of other things (not just toads)
  
- there were a lot a sampling gaps
  - calculated the probability of breeding to fill in these gaps using a general linear model

- a deletion of a single meadow would affect numerous meadows in the park

Analysis:
Toad Breeding = aX + bY + cZ +...+ r(StockUse)
--> useful for prediction, but not for understanding; this is important

Permutation Approach:
- infer some sort of causality from observation
- 100 meadows; 10 with breeding, 10 with horses. About 2/10 have overlap.

- reassigned the horse meadows using the distribution we already had
- environmental gradient
  - more breeding and more horses up at the top
  - the ones on the bottom have very few
- all else being equal, what does this relationship look like by chance?
  - shuffle the assignment of horses within a strata
    - stratified shuffle to make it more representative 
    
Results:
- did not see a negative relationship between breeding and horses after simulating 10,000 permutations
- weak evidence that the horses help the toads --> not what they were expecting

Potential Errors:

- errors in toad detection
  - false negatives
  - BUT there was no bias in terms of number of visits made, etc.
  - concluded that this error was unlikely to change the relationship between horse meadows and toads
  
- errors reported stock use
  - responses may not be honest, etc.
  - concluded that the rank order is not necessarily going to change anything; no reason why there should
    be a systematic bias; it is more likely that EVERYONE is under-reporting, meaning that it wouldn't change
    the results we are seeing

- errors in stock use location

*these data would be extremeely surprising if the relationship between packstock and toads were negative

NEW APPROACH:
-------------

introduced fish    -------->    frogs (in lakes)

- it is known that the fish devour the tadpoles

Recap:
- blended a simple predictive occupancy model with network analysis to 
  - predict isolated breeding meadows
  - predict meadows with high park-wide deletion impact

- blended a simple predictuve occupancy model with permutatino approach to 
  - infer the effect of a rare stressor on a rare species (all else equal)
